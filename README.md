# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
# 

# 1.  What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined approach to the entire software development lifecycle, focusing on producing high-quality, maintainable software, whereas traditional programming primarily involves writing code to solve specific problems without necessarily considering long-term maintenance and broader project management.


#  2. Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
(a)Requirements Analysis:
Identify user needs and project scope.
Document requirements clearly.

(b)Design:
Create a detailed software blueprint.
Define system architecture and interfaces.

(c)Implementation:
Write and integrate code.
Follow coding standards.

(d)Testing:
Verify software quality.
Identify and fix defects.

(e)Deployment:
Release software to users.
Ensure smooth transition.

(f)Maintenance:
Provide ongoing support.
Implement updates and fixes.


#  3. Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Agile emphasizes flexibility and iterative development, while Waterfall follows a sequential, fixed plan; Agile encourages ongoing customer collaboration, whereas Waterfall involves customers primarily at the beginning and end; Agile allows for changes throughout the process, whereas Waterfall follows a more rigid plan; Agile values working software over comprehensive documentation, whereas Waterfall emphasizes thorough documentation at each stage; Agile typically delivers working software in shorter iterations, while Waterfall may take longer to deliver a complete product.

# 4. What is requirements engineering? 
Requirements engineering is the systematic process of gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves identifying, defining, and prioritizing functional and non-functional requirements to ensure that the resulting software meets the desired objectives and specifications.

# 5. Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering involves gathering, analyzing, documenting, and managing stakeholder needs for a software system. It ensures alignment between the software and stakeholder expectations, reduces risks, enhances efficiency, facilitates communication, and enables effective project management throughout the software development lifecycle.

# 6. Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
odularity in software design involves breaking down systems into smaller, independent components, improving maintainability by isolating changes and easing debugging, while also enhancing scalability through incremental development and resource efficiency.

# 7. Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

# 8. What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

# 9. Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

# 10. Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

# 11. What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
